  Using this wizard will aid you in the creation of new <strong>capital projects</strong>.
%p
  The wizard will take you through a series of <strong>five steps</strong> that will guide you through the process of defining how this capital project will operate.
%p
  <strong>It is important to make sure:</strong>
  %ul
    %li that the state of your inventory is <strong>up-to-date</strong>, so that the most accurate information can be used for the project and, subsequently, reporting.
    %li that you have all of the relevant information about the capital project that you plan to undertake. The <strong>scope</strong> of the project itself will be very important, because this will affect the assets with which the project can be aligned.
%p
  Once created, you will have a programmable capital project. With it, you will be able to add activity line items, and identify the assets from your inventory that will be replaced, purchased, improved, or demonstrated.
%p
  Once the full cost of the project has been accounted for, it will be considered fully programmed, and will be able to be moved to a 'pending', and then 'approved', status.
